## Explanation

In this correlation analysis I have taken the pool of 5 projects ("rust","aframe","kubernetes","containerd","rkt") and have taken their data of the following 10 variables ("ProjectDays","TotalCommits","DistinctCommitters",
"TotalClosedIssues", "PullRequestDuration", "PullRequestCommentDuration" ,"CommitsDuration", "IssueCommentsDuration","ClosedIssues"). 

On the basis of this, I have run the correlation on these five projects. Going forward the goal is to interact with a database of all the different variables, run the correlation on the pool of different projects, and cross-compare that correlation among various pools.
